# Six Principles of IT Security

As part of a new job, I was required to take an internal training on the 'Six Principles of IT Security'

The below article contains my notes.

## Overview

Principles:
- Protecting Software, Libraries & Applications
- Protecting Credentials & Data
- Managing Access
- Ensuring you always build resiliency into your systems and applications
- Recognize that you are a highly prized target in your industry

### Principal 1: Protecting Software, Libraries & Applications
From the training: "As a tech or product owner you may be directly responsible for implementing patching and updating code, other patching processes may include the assisting of patching or validation. In either case, you should know your role and take patching and updating serious as a first line of defense against adversaries." 

<u>Patching our systems and code includes:</u>
- Operating Systems
- Server and Desktop Applications
- Commercial and Open Source software
- Network Devices, Appliances, Firmware

While there are various parties responsible for each of the above, we all have individual responsibilities to enusre proper Policies & Procedures are followed within our realm of responsibility. Even if that is just restarting our computers each night.

<u>Code Toolsets that can assist in protecting software & code:</u>
- GitHub
- JFrog Artifactory
- CI/CD Enterprise Framework

#### GitHub
- [GH Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) - scan for secrets in code
    - code scanning - discovers security vulnerabilities and coding errors
    - dependency review - identifies insecure dependencies in the code
- [Pull Requests, PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) - process to ensure proper validations and approvals are in place. Ensure your code is reviewed by your peers, in order to meet branch policies for your project.
- Jira to GitHub integration - Ensures traceability of the code to requirements
