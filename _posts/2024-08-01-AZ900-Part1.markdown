# Why the AZ-900?
In my previous [post](https://joelholland2.github.io/article/2024/08/01/Technical-Certifications.html), I provided a fairly extensive list of certifications/learning resources for various technologies & methodoligies that I want to pursue to deepen my knowledge of the core technologies & concepts I need to perform my current as a Business Intelligence Analyst, as well as help me move towards becoming a Data Engineer. The core of our tech stack is Azure, and while I do have some knowledge, it's gapped and limited. The AZ 900 is the foundational certification offered by Microsoft, and where i believe makes the most sense for me to start.

# What is the AZ-900
This Certification is there to show you know the basics of Azure, and really serves as the starting point for anyone who works in or around Azure. From [Microsoft's Website: ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification&WT.mc_id=certposter_poster-wwl) 

"Demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud concepts, core Azure services, plus Azure management and governance features and tools."

# Resources I'll be using
While there's many resources to prep for the AZ-900, including free ones from Microsoft, I choose to go with a learning path that I have access for free through my company.

This [Learning Path](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-az-900-certification) is led by Kunal D Mehta and is broken into 4 courses:
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 1 Cloud Concepts
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 2 Azure Architecture and Security
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 3 Azure Services
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 4 Azure Management and Governance

The remainder of this article will be focused on what I learned from the first course in this learning path
