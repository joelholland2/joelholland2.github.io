# Why the AZ-900?
In my previous [post](https://joelholland2.github.io/article/2024/08/01/Technical-Certifications.html), I provided a fairly extensive list of certifications/learning resources for various technologies & methodoligies that I want to pursue to deepen my knowledge of the core technologies & concepts I need to perform my current as a Business Intelligence Analyst, as well as help me move towards becoming a Data Engineer. The core of our tech stack is Azure, and while I do have some knowledge, it's gapped and limited. The AZ 900 is the foundational certification offered by Microsoft, and where i believe makes the most sense for me to start. Learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification&WT.mc_id=certposter_poster-wwl)

# What is the AZ-900
This Certification is there to show you know the basics of Azure, and really serves as the starting point for anyone who works in or around Azure. From [Microsoft's Website: ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification&WT.mc_id=certposter_poster-wwl) 

"Demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud concepts, core Azure services, plus Azure management and governance features and tools."

# Resources I'll be using
While there's many resources to prep for the AZ-900, including free ones from Microsoft, I choose to go with a learning path that I have access for free through my company.

This [Learning Path](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-az-900-certification) is led by Kunal D Mehta and is broken into 4 courses:
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 1 Cloud Concepts
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 2 Azure Architecture and Security
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 3 Azure Services
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 4 Azure Management and Governance

The remainder of this article will be focused on what I learned from the first course in this learning path

# Part 1: Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing?

From Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cert Prep: 1 Cloud Concepts:

"Cloud computing is the delivery of any computing resources from the IT stack as a service, by a cloud service provider"

Below you'll find a table with the Traditional IT Stack. Pre-cloud, a business had to own all of this. However they really only care about *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">this</span>*. The rest is typically expensive to set up and maintain and has very little benefit to be owned by a company. Azure can provide all of *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">this</span>*, so you don't have to. Additionally, cloud computing can seamlessly break into smaller or larger parts, and for all practical purposes is endless in terms of capabilities/resources. Traditionally the ability to expand and contract in size or number of components would be labor, time, and cost intensive.

| Traditional IT Stack      |
|:-----------:|
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Data</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Application</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Framework & runtime</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Patches & Hotfixes</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Operation System</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Hardware</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Power, Colling, Internet</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Physical Space</span>*       |

## Virtualization is the Foundation for Cloud

 <u>There are 3 elementary pieces of a computer:</u>
 
 |Processor|Memory|Hard Disk|

Virtualization not only allows you to replicate these pieces, but gives mobility to them.

In other words you virtualization allows for as many instances of these pieces to operate independently and unaware of eachother on the same system and allows you to scale the size of those pieces up or down as needed.

|1|Processor|Memory|Hard Disk|
|2|<span style="font-size:20px;">Processor</span>|<span style="font-size:20px;">Memory</span>|<span style="font-size:20px;">Hard Disk</span>|
|3|<span style="font-size:8px;">Processor</span>|<span style="font-size:8px;">Memory</span>|<span style="font-size:8px;">Hard Disk</span>|

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

There are 4 Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
- Resource Pooling
- Elasticity
- Pay per Use
- Automation

### Resource Pooling
Technical term to describe the ability to use the cloud to access as much/as many resources as needed. Applies to processor, memory & hard disk
### Elasticity
Allows you to scale up or down your resources infinitely
### Pay per Use
You only pay for what you use & for how long you used it for
### Automation
Resource provisions are automatic, so you don't have a reliance on others when adjustments are needed.

## Understand Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
IaaS is 1/3 of what is offered via Cloud Services, focused on the hardware

In other words, the *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">below</span>* is handled by the cloud and being used by itself would give the customer full responsibility of the operating environment, application, and data.

| Traditional IT Stack      |
|:-----------:|
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Data</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Application</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Framework & runtime</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Patches & Hotfixes</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Operation System</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Hardware</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Power, Colling, Internet</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Physical Space</span>*       |

## Understand Platform as a Service (Paas)

PaaS is 2/3 of what is offered via Cloud Services, focused on all that is offered via Iaas + the Platform.

In other words, the *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">below</span>* is handled by the cloud and being used by itself would give the customer responsibility for only the application and data.

| Traditional IT Stack      |
|:-----------:|
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Data</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Application</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Framework & runtime</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Patches & Hotfixes</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Operation System</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Hardware</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Power, Colling, Internet</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Physical Space</span>*       |

## Understand Software as a Service (Saas)

SaaS is 3/3 of what is offered via Cloud Services, focused on all that is offered via Iaas + Paas + the Software.

There's limited application availability, however minimal configuration and time is needed to get started using the full IT stack.

In other words, the *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">below</span>* is handled by the cloud and being used would give the customer responsibility for only the data.

| Traditional IT Stack      |
|:-----------:|
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:gray">Data</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Application</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Framework & runtime</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Patches & Hotfixes</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Operation System</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Hardware</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Power, Colling, Internet</span>*       |
| *<span style="color:white; background-color:green">Physical Space</span>*       |

## Understand the Shared Responsibility Model

To summarize the last few sections, depending on the level of service, the cloud service provider and the business have varying levels of responsibility as demonstrated in the table below:

| Traditional IT Stack | On-Premises | Iaas | Paas | Saas |
|:-----------:| 
| *Data* | Business | Business | Business | Business |
| *Application* |Business | Business | Business | CSP |
| *Framework & runtime* |Business | Business | CSP | CSP |
| *Patches & Hotfixes*  |Business | Business | CSP | CSP |
| *Operation System* |Business | Business | CSP | CSP |
| *Hardware* |Business | CSP | CSP | CSP |
| *Power, Colling, Internet* |Business | CSP | CSP | CSP |
| *Physical Space* |Business | CSP | CSP | CSP |

## Understand Public Cloud

Public Clouds share physical resources, but virtualization ensures they're dedicated to you and can't be accessed by other tenants who are a part of that public cloud's multi-tenancy. It is extremely well protected.

||Secure Data||Cloud||Multi-tenancy||
|:-----------:| :-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|Tenant|Tenant|Tenant|Tenant|Tenant|Tenant|Tenant|

## Understand Private Cloud

Private Clouds are Single Tenancy Hardware owned by the corportation. Largely used by those not comfortable with public clouds or where it is illegal for a public cloud to be used. 

Both private clouds and traditional on-prem IT stacks are managed internally, but private clouds offer greater flexibility, automation, and scalability, akin to public cloud environments. 

Traditional on-prem IT stacks tend to involve more manual management and less dynamic resource allocation.

Resources are still limited compared to a public cloud and can be less reliable in terms of disaster recovery failovers.

## Understand Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid clouds allows for the best of both worlds, allowing for the control and security of a private cloud, but the potential processing power (cloud burst) of the public cloud if needed, as well as a much more resilient disaster recovery (i.e. more regions availalble for failovers)

## Understand Sovereign Clouds

Some countries have cloud space utilizes purely by that country's government organizations, or in China's case, some organizations within that country. Effectively a private cloud, but at a country level and with limited tenants to have greater security than what's offered by the public cloud.

## Understand Elasticity

## Understand Scalability

## Understand High-Availability

## Understand Fault Tolerance

## Understand Disaster Recovery

## Understand Security in the Cloud

## Understand Management and Governance
