The Kimball Method of Dimensional Modeling is one of the original and most widely respected methods to base the design of a Data Warehouse after. The Data Warehouse is the official and definitive guide for this method, and while it has been around for some time, has stood the test of time and continues to be extremely relevant even in today's modern data landscape.
