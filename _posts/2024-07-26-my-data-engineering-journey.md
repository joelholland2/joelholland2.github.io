# My Journey in Data Engineering

## My Career Background

My journey isn't orthodox (I expect few Data professionals would consider their journey to be orthodox). 

After graduating High School, I had no idea what I wanted to do and decided that even if I didn't know what path I was on, I needed to take a first step. I ended up working in a warehouse before serving as a missionary for my church. 

After my mission, I knew that I wanted to progress in a career, and not knowing what would be best, I figured that I'd start by getting degree in business and find an entry level job to help pay for it.

The job I ended up finding was at a large company, part-time, and designed for college students. The job was boring, involved a lot of phone time and repetitive conversations. However, it was also where I started to get exposure to technology, data, & reporting.

I jokingly like to say that the only useful course I took was one that taught me about excel Macros, the rest I learned from Google. Jokes aside I ended up using VBA to make myself more efficient by making a macro that highlighted the cell I was on with a key stroke. We used massive spreadsheets to track the clients we called, and this macro saved me maybe 2 clicks, <1 second per client. While likely unnecessary, it was the start of me understanding that technology could be used to make things more efficient.

After a couple of years, I ended up moving up into a similar, slightly less entry-level job. My responsibilities and interactions with more processes grew and I was able to advance my technical skills to create, enhance, and fix a variety of excel based tools that improved the efficiency of not only myself, but dozens of other employees like me who were doing the same processes. At this point, I haven't worked much with Data, but began to realized I wanted to do something more technical.

My first true Data role was as a Data Analytics Associate on a very small team of 3 which I was shoulder tapped to join after my management saw some of the projects I had worked on. This team not only did data analytics, but also created/managed a variety of Access & Excel based tools to fill the gaps in our dying CRM's processes, improve quality of work, and increase efficiency. This role is where I really began to dive into what data roles where out there, and started to think through what I wanted to do. I spent a good deal of time building Access based applications, creating crude ETL processes based primarily in Access, automating various processes via VBA, etc. On top of this, I developed my data analysis skills.

After a couple of years, this lead me into my next role of International Data Analyst. From a technical development perspective, it was like drinking from a firehose. I learned SQL, R, non-Excel visualization tools (Power BI), CRM based reporting (SFDC), and began to feel out what I really enjoyed doing each day. I found that while I was good at analyzing data, making it visually appealing, and helping stakeholders draw conclusions, it wasn't my favorite to do. However, ask me to find 40 different data points from 5 different systems and transform and aggregate the raw data into a consumable format for users to then use for analysis and I'd skip lunch, work late, spend hours on forums and google, etc. I loved it. In the midst of this role, my company began to modernize it's tech stack and many of the skills I had, began to be less and less useful. I knew if I wanted to keep moving foward, I needed to seriously advance my technical skills and knowledge of/experience with modern data tech stacks. I decided I wanted to move into the data engineering space and there wasn't a clear path to that in the role I was in.

## Where I'm at now

After more than two years in my previous role I was able to work with my company to move into a Business Intelligence Analyst role. This role has a direct and clear path to becoming a Data Engineer. At the time of this post, I've just started and couldn't be more excited, albeit a bit anxious. While the path is there, it's going to be the most challenging part of my career yet. My technical skills are rudimentary when compared with my new peers, and what others learned in school and/or more direct previous roles, I'll have to learn now.

## This site's purpose

My purpose in starting this site was to give myself a way to document my career journey into Data Engineering and beyond. This post is the first of hopefully many that document where I came from, where I am now and where I plan to go next.

## Next Steps

I'm going to continue to learn my newly choosen craft, write about what I discover, document personal projects, & share my career growth experiences. I look forward to the personal growth and future of my career!
