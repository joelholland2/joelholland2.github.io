# Hi! I'm Joel Holland
I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst and Aspiring Data Engineer. This site is dedicated to my learning journey and a place to showcase my work.

I started my career as an operational specialist. I was very good at finding ways to make mine and others work more efficient via the use of technology. 
This opened up opportunities to use those skills (and develop many more) to make data available in clean, digestable formats.

I'm passionate about developing lasting data solutions in a modern data-centered world. This has lead me to my role as a Business Intelligence Analyst.

I'm currently looking to network with other data professionals to continue my growth in my current and future roles.
